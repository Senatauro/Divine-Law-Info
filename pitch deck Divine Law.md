# pitch deck of Divine Law

## Introduction
------------------
## What is Divine Law

Divine Law is a game with blockchain able to make players and investors earn tokens through their in-game abilities and their contribution to its ecosystem. Players take care of their farms to produce food and material, fighting to earn gold and glory, transforming fragile weapons and weak soldiers into legendary items and powerful heroes.

    All of this action in a Game with blockchain support, not a gamified blockchain.


## Value Proposition

Our Value Proposition is divided in 4:

### Play-to-Earn:

As a game with blockchain support, we're able to have our own game economy, where players can earn tokens by playing the game. This tokens are used inside the game to restore itens, buy new ones and set global and local events. This is the main value proposition of the game.

### Competitive landscape:

A competitive game where players play alone or form teams of 2 or 4 to battle agains each other for the glory of the gods, the Divine Decree.  

### Metadata:

Unlocking the full power of the blockchain NFT's with true Metadata, not a database link. Your NFTs will be truly unique, holding their informations about battles, achievements, usages, etc... and allowing the owner to add custom information.

### Customization:

Together with the metadatas we put in our NFTs, the player can customize their soldiers, heroes and armies to their needs, enabling the creation of ***something really unique***. Every character is modular, with a lot of options to customize it: Helmets, gloves, chestplates, boots, weapons, etc... This way we make possible to the player to really have something unique in terms of customization.

## Farm mode

The Farm game mode is inspired by other similar games with an interactive staking, where the player will be able to use BNB to buy NFT plants and animals and start generating income for the main game. These NFTs will function as an interactive staking, which require daily care so as to not lose their profitability by dying. Likewise, the staking system transforms itself from passive to active, needing day-to-day interaction with the player to take care of their own investments

## Battle mode

The Battle game mode is inspired by other famous games, especially Warcraft. For those that have already played Warcraft 3, you must remember how it was full of custom maps, such as DotA, Angel Arena, Jungle Race, etc. 

This Battle game mode is envisioned in one of these maps, Legion TD, a competitive PvEvP mode where players recruit soldiers to fight hordes of enemies that are trying to kill the king. For more information regarding this game mode, please check the next subsections. Divine Law will have its real gameplay once the Battle mode is launched for windows and later for android.

## Future modes

We want Divine Law to work as a Metaverse, so in the future we plan modes such as Moba, Element TD, Adventure, Clan Wars, etc.

## Market Analysis

### Year of the crypto

2021 was annouced as the year of the cryptocoins. A lot of new holders are made, regular people got the cryptocoins buzz and the market is grown a lot.

We aim to take this crypto market buzz as a opportunity to make our game a success.

### TAM-SAM-SOM

On 14/12/21, we received the following data from the market:

Token info:
TAM-SAM-SOM - Valor (info by coinmarketcap and dapp radar)
TAM: 89b  - Value of BNB in USD
SAM: 500m - Value of all game tokens
SOM: 25m  - 5% of the game token market cap

Users info:
TAM-SAM-SOM - Usuários (info by coinmarketcap and dapp radar)
TAM: 122m - Usuários da BSC
SAM: 1m   - Usuários que jogam
SOM: 50k  - 5% of the users that play crypto games

* If we account the total of players that do not play cripto games and may start playing our game, the amount of possible players get a lot larger.

For our game we aim to get *at least* the SOM value, the point where we can with certainty claim that our game is a success.

## Tokens

We will have 4 tokens on our game

### Divine Decree

Given by the gods, this token represents their will, and so it is capable of influencing global decisions and events

### Food

Armies do not only fight, but they also need to eat too. Food is used to replenish your soldier's forces and energy

### Material

Swords crack, spears break and armor gets pierced. Supplies will be needed for vital repairs.

### Glory

Soldiers crave a fight and heroes live for battle. Glory attracts new soldiers and encourages heroes to do more glorious deeds.


## Tokenomics

Divine Decree token will be distributed in 5 categories:

Token Sale (ICO): 25.000.000 (10%)
Marketing: 7.500.000 (3%)
Community: 7.500.000 (3%)
Divine Team: 10.000.000 (4%)
Strategic Sale: 75.000.000 (30%)
Rewards and Ecosystem: 125.000.000 (50%)

Total: 250.000.000 (100%)

Tokens from the ICO will be locked for 20 months and released at a linear rate starting from early March.

50% of the BNB collected will be used to create a locked liquidity pool where the initial value of the Divine Decree will be $1.



## NFTnomics

Several NFT games have a big problem: The infinite generation of NFTs without the possibility of burning or a way to decrease their NFT population. With this issue in mind, the BEP721 standard will be extended with new features to allow NFTs to burn and "refresh". It will be possible to maintain a healthy population of NFTs, without the supply or demand for it being too high.

All NFTs will build on the BEP-721 standard (ERC-721 for Binance Smart Chain) and will be extended with metadata and other functionalities.

### Burning NFTs

Every NFT, except the lands, inside Divine Law will have a limit of uses to it. NFTs can be regenerated by the owner for 3 times using food, material and/or glory. This way we can ensure that the NFTs economy does not inflate and drop the price.

### Metadata

Inside Divine Law, Metadata are persistent and dynamic data related to what a specific NFT has achieved during the farm mode or battle mode. These achievements will work similar to how Steam manages their achievements. Some metadata will only be received if the player wins the battle. These metadatas are directly written on the NFT, making it unique and increasing its value. Some examples:

| MetaData |
|---|
| Element |
| Enemies Killed |
| Times died |
| Total damage dealt|
| Tier |

These metadatas will be used to set the achievements to the NFT. Like:

| Achievement| Required | Bonus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Genocide | Killed more than 1k enemies | +X damage per attack |
| Boxer | Be on 25 matches without any weapon or shield | +X damage when no weapon is equipped|
| Coward | When hired | Attacks faster when away from enemies, slower when close |
